        <p>W3C standards define an <b>Open Web Platform</b> for application development that has the unprecedented
            potential to enable developers to build rich interactive experiences, powered by vast data stores, that are
            available on any device. Although the boundaries of the platform continue to evolve, industry leaders speak
            nearly in unison about how <span style="color: rgb(17, 0, 255)">HTML5</span> will be the cornerstone for this
            platform. But the full strength of the platform relies on many more technologies that W3C and its partners
            are creating, including <i>CSS, SVG, WOFF</i>, the Semantic Web stack, <i>XML</i>, and a variety of APIs.</p>

        <p><span style="background: rgb(87, 178, 238);">W3C develops these technical specifications and guidelines through a process designed to maximize consensus
            about the content of a technical report, to ensure high technical and editorial quality, and to earn
            endorsement by W3C and the broader community.</span></p>
