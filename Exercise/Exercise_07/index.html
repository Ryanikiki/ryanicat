    <p>What causes errors in HTML?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not closed properly, then its effect can spread to areas you
                didn't intend</strong></li>
        <li>Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important for code behaving correctly.
            <strong>strong <em>strong emphasised?</strong> what is this?</em>
        </li>

        <li>Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's look at an example: <a
                href="https://www.mozilla.org/">link to Mozilla homepage</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
